            <div class="earl"><p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve<br/>
            my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing<br/>
            some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell<br/>
            phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more<br/>
            sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)<br/>
            made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that<br/>-m
            the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p></div>
